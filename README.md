### hii its vineet,
  3rd yr cs student trying his best to get job. 
  I've learned bunch of classical ml, like math behind ml algorithms and their implementaion in scikit-learn. recently i've started diving 
  into deep larning and neural network stuff and i'm planning to learn bunch of cool NN architectures.
  in parallel i'm also learning applied ai stuff like rag, agents and practical implementation of these systems in real world. 
  i've explored word embeddings and nlp stuff a lil bit and that stuff really excites me, will be working on nlp stuff in future fs. 
  the ultimate goal is to work on some really cool and important problem in ml/dl along with giants in field.
### skills
- languages : python, javascript.
- frameworks : pytorch, scikit-learn, django.
- libraries : numpy, pandas.
- classical ml like classification, regression, clustering, parameter tuning, feature extraction, feature scaling, model evaluation, data cleaning, pipelines, ensemble methods, boosting etc.

#### **I WILL MAKE IT.**
